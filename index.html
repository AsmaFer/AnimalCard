                Giraffes are the tallest mammals on Earth. Their legs alone are taller than many humansâ€”about 6 feet.<br/>
                They can run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances, or cruise at 10 mph over longer distances.<br/>
                A giraffe's neck is too short to reach the ground. As a result, it has to awkwardly spread its front legs or kneel to reach the ground for a drink of water.
